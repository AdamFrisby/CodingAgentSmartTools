# Coding Agent Smart Tools `cast`
New tools for baking into containers which improve agentic coding behaviours, currently work for C#/.NET based projects which support the Roslyn compiler.

## Why?
Well, apparently all the LLMs out there think `sed` is the height of programmer efficiency - modern IDEs have modern refactoring tools; this project brings them to your LLM.

This should make refactoring code via coding agents much, much safer - and faster too.
